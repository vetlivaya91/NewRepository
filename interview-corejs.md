### Question examples:
   * Data types in JS. Type coercion.
   * What is hoisting?
   * Let vs var. Const.
   * Passing data by value and by reference. Examples.
   * `{a: 10} == {a: 10}`. What will the code return?
   * What is `this`?
   * Apply, call, bind. What are they used for? What are the differences?
   * Closure. Give an example.
   * Array methods that loop over the elements.
   * Object methods to iterate over the elements
   * Map, Set, WeakMap, WeakSet
   * Browser events. Browser default actions abortion.
   * Event bubbling and event capturing.
   * Event delegation. Example.
   * Event loop. Explain how stack and two queues communicate with each other in the loop?
   * Promises
   * spread/rest
   * Any other questions on CoreJS/DOM/Event Loop/Inheritance/etc.
                         
### Coding tasks:
* `Function.prototype.bind` implement polyfill
* `Object.create` implement polyfill
* `Array.flat` implement polyfill
* `hello world.repeating(3) -> hello world hello world hello world`. How to implement?
* `('!', 4, -10, 34, 0) -> 4!-10!34!0`
* `five(plus(seven(minus(three())))) -> 9`
* `add(5)(9)(-4)(1) -> 11`
* `periodOutput(period)` method should output in the console once per every period how much time left from the function first call. 
  Example:
  `periodOutput(100) -> 100(after 100 ms), 200(after 100 ms), 300(after 100 ms), ...`
* `extendedPeriodOutput(period)` method should output in the console once per period how much time left from the function first call and increase the period. Example: `// extendedPeriodOutput(100) -> 100(after 100 ms), 200(after 200 ms), 300(after 300 ms)`


### Excluded topics
   * Iterators and generators
