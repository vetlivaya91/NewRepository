# rs-school-activist

The goal of the assignment is to encourage students to help each other in school chat rooms.

Every week, mentors will review students’ activity in chat rooms and select 1-5 most active students who will be awarded additional points that will count towards the final score.

## Assessment criteria
The following performance indicators will be used:

* how thoughtful the questions are (whether a student requests to make a task more precise or provide more details about it after trying to solve it on his/her own, makes some common errors, etc., posts his/her code and offers possible solutions)
* how well the solution is explained
* whether answers provided relate to upcoming tasks
* whether questions asked by other students are responded to in a friendly manner, without bullying and insulting 
* student's own constructive initiative regarding teaching/learning process management (FAQ)


## Scoring

Students are selected by mentors who participate in chat conversations on a voluntary basis and who can give a more or less unbiased assessment.

At the end of each week, voting is held to select from candidates on the list prepared by mentors who coordinate this assignment. 

Students recognized as activists are awarded 25 points.

The final impact on the overall score will be determined at the end of each stage.
